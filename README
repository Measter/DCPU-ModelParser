DCPU-ModelParser
================

Allows the programmer to input SPED-3 model data in as raw vertex
coordinates couple with indices, and will convert it to a SPED-3
compliant data format.

The example file was written to be assembled by Organic, though
with some label adjustment should work in other assemblers.
